# Project Name

## Description
This project consists of a backend and frontend application. The backend is built using Node.js with Express, while the frontend is built using React.

## Steps to Run Locally
1. **Backend**:
    - Navigate to the `backend` directory.
    - Install dependencies using npm: `npm install`.
    - Start the development server: `npm run dev`.
    - The backend will be running on port `5000`.

2. **Frontend**:
    - Navigate to the `frontend` directory.
    - Install dependencies using npm: `npm install`.
    - Start the development server: `npm start`.
    - The frontend will be running on port `3000`.

## Important Packages and Uses
### Backend:
- **Express**: For building the RESTful API.
- **Cors**: To enable Cross-Origin Resource Sharing.
- **Dotenv**: For loading environment variables from a `.env` file.

### Frontend:

## Usage of Lighthouse for Performance
Lighthouse is a tool for improving the quality of web pages. It measures performance, accessibility, best practices, and SEO. In this project, Lighthouse was used to analyze and optimize the performance of the frontend application. After making optimizations suggested by Lighthouse, the application achieved better loading times and overall performance.

## Hosted URLs
